5.14.20 See 'py2app' notes at the end. 
With the setup.py file here, can get a workable app using py2app. 

Still need a .icns (icon) file...

5.14.20 pyinstaller SimpleRigolGrab.py 

Get an error: 
...
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/PyInstaller/building/utils.py", line 662, in strip_paths_in_code
    return code_func(co.co_argcount, co.co_kwonlyargcount, co.co_nlocals, co.co_stacksize,
TypeError: an integer is required (got type bytes)

I'm running /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin/python3

pyinstaller -version is 3.4 

This has come up on the internets: 
https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4580

With statement that:
 "PyInstaller currently doesn't support 3.8. I suggest you build with 3.7 or 
 earlier until python 3.8 is supported"

Suggestion at https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4265
is to: 
    "pip install https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.tar.gz
    Direct install the latest version can compatible with python 3.8"

An alternative may be fbs 
https://www.learnpyqt.com/courses/packaging-and-distribution/packaging-pyqt5-apps-fbs/

------

And can try py2app

... following https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#create-a-setup-py-file

the app does not contain the menubar icon... OK, add it to the py2applet argument list
which then lists the file (grabbericon.png) in the DATA_FILES entry: 

    APP = ['SimpleRigolGrab.py']
    DATA_FILES = ['grabbericon.png']
    OPTIONS = {}

And there you go! (in alias mode)

Try python setup.py py2app to create for deployment... 
and get error!

Discussion here:

with a solution... 

OK, works. have a "SimpleRigolGrab" application... 

Holy crap, dist/ (i.e the app) contains 2K+ (2949) files... 
and the app is 233.7 MB. 

But it works.
